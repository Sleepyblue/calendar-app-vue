Good question!
The calendar application is being developed as a technical challenge to enhance my skills and explore the intricacies of building a robust web application from scratch. It also provides an opportunity to delve into user experience (UX) design principles and address the need for inclusive and user-friendly designs in calendar (and all) applications.

I aim to focus on a solid keyboard navigation ensuring that those who rely (or want to) on keyboard navigation can effectively interact with every feature implemented on the calendar.

### <a id="features">Features</a>
>Please refer to the *About* section in the repository to explore the complete list of tools I'm using

The current features of the calendar application include:
- *Event Creation:* Events can be created in the following manner:
	- Clicking on a specific hour;
	- Using the *click & drag* functionality
	- Using the dedicated *"Add Event"* button
- *Event Deletion:* Events can be deleted by choosing the target event and clicking on the *trash* icon present on the preview
- *Event Edition:* Events can be edited by choosing the target event and clicking on the *edit* icon present on the preview. This will open a modal similar to the creation one, allowing you to edit the event.
- *Event focus*: When clicking on an event it will scroll to, and ensure the preview is placed within the visible area of the calendar.
- *Persistence of Events:* Created events remain assigned to their respective *day/week* even when navigating between different *weeks*

Ouch!
Let's talk about the elephant(s) on the room 😬

While progress has been made in developing the calendar application, some challenges and limitations still exist:
- ⌨ **"What's all this talk about keyboard navigation? I only see clicking interaction 🤔"** ... and you are right! Still on the process of learning how to properly handle some *things* so baby steps, I need to start somewhere!
- 💻 Currently, the layout is **only** designed for desktop use not being yet optimized for mobile devices.
- 💾 The application **does not have** a backend or utilizes `localStorage`, so refreshing the browser will invariably result in data loss.
- 🧪 Testing is a *bit* behind at the moment. I know, I know, no excuses! 😵
